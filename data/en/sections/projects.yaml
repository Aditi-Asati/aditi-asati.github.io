  summary: "I conducted in-depth research on using synthetic data to mitigate site effects from structural MRI data. I designed and implemented the SMOTE algorithm in Python to generate synthetic data points and built pipelines for running various experiments using Scikit-learn, Python, and Shell Scripting to explore their effectiveness on brain age prediction. Furthermore, I articulated my research findings in a detailed thesis document and successfully defended the work in a 30-minute oral presentation, securing 8.9/10 project score."
